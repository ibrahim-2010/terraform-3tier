# LocalStack for 3-Tier Architecture Testing
# ===========================================
# Simulates AWS services locally for development/testing
#
# LocalStack Community Edition supports: EC2, VPC, IAM, STS, S3, Security Groups
# LocalStack Pro (paid) adds: ELBv2 (ALB), RDS, ECS, and more
#
# What this means for you:
# - VPC, subnets, security groups, and EC2 instances will work with terraform apply
# - ALB and RDS will NOT work on Community — use terraform validate + python run.py
# - See the web-preview container below for a simulated web tier page

version: '3.8'

  # Since LocalStack Community cannot run a real ALB, this nginx container
  # serves a preview of what the web tier page would look like in production.
